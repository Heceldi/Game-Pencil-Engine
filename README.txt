Website: http://create.pawbyte.com/
Email: code@pawbyte.com

Please report all bugs, suggestions and feedback to code@pawbyte.com

--------------------------------------------------

This is a very primitive version of the editor.
Most menus and sub-systems are meant for the final build, however; the core functionalty of saving/exporting projects is not present.

These features will appear in the next update(Scheduled for May 7, 2015).

This editor is coded completely in C/C++ and uses the SDL Library for display, input, output and audio.
Please note that using the .MP3 format is strongly not reccommended due to licensing fees.
